# Circulation-embedded-CBF-A-solution-to-avoid-undesired-equilibria-and-dysfunctional-circulation
This repository provides a simulation reproducing the experiments from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.robot.2025.105132, including the simulator, source code, and data.  Contains two scenarios, nonconvex obstacle avoidance and multi-agent deadlock resolution using IBCECBFQP, each runnable via lidar_gp_cbf/sim2D_main.

# Circulation-Embedded CBF — Code & Simulations

Simulation
This repository includes a simulator that visualizes the robotic experiment as the code runs.
When executed, the simulation window will open and display the robot’s behavior step by step.

Code and simulation assets for the paper:
> **Circulation-embedded CBF: A solution to avoid undesired equilibria and dysfunctional circulation**  
> Shaghayegh Keyumarsi et al.

How to run
Nonconvex obstacle simulation

python nonconvex-sim/lidar_gp_cbf/sim2D_main.py

Multi-agent deadlock resolution

python multiagent-deadlock-sim/lidar_gp_cbf/sim2D_main.py

Outputs & animations
Generated media are saved under each module’s animation_result/ (tracked in Git).

Re-running scripts may overwrite existing files.
